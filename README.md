# ⭐Plant-Disease-Detection
* Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we have created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into 29 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Tensorflow Framework using Resnet50 architecture the model is deployed on streamlit which displays fertizers and remedies according to the disease predicted. For Training we are using Plant village dataset. Here is our demo video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDANF0JOCpI&t=1s. Dataset Link is in My Blog Section.
We are still in progress of developing this project in future we are planning to integrate the quality of soil moisture and improve the prediction part.

## ⭐huggingface deployment but only indexed for full deployment need streamlit 
* Here is the link for hugging face deployment : https://huggingface.co/spaces/SurajJha21/plantdiseasemodel2
* these are indexing if ypu dont want to run streamlit for reference:-
* class_to_label = {
    0: 'Apple Scab',
    1: 'Apple_Black Rot',
    2: 'Bacterial Spot_Pepper',
    3: 'Bacterial Spot_peach',
    4: 'Bacterial Spot_tmt',
    5: 'Black Rot_grape',
    6: 'Cedar Apple Rust',
    7: 'Cercospora Leaf Spot_corn',
    8: 'Common Rust_corn',
    9: 'Early Blight_potato',
    10: 'Early Blight_tmt',
    11: 'Esca (Black Measles)_grape',
    12: 'Healthy_Apple',
    13: 'Healthy_Pepper',
    14: 'Healthy_cherry',
    15: 'Healthy_corn',
    16: 'Healthy_grape',
    17: 'Healthy_peach',
    18: 'Healthy_potato',
    19: 'Healthy_strb',
    20: 'Healthy_tmt',
    21: 'Late Blight_potato',
    22: 'Late Blight_tmt',
    23: 'Leaf Blight_grape',
    24: 'Leaf Scorch_strb',
    25: 'Northern Leaf Blight_corn',
    26: 'Powdery Mildew_cherry',
    27: 'Septoria Leaf Spot_tmt',
    28: 'Yellow Leaf Curl Virus_tmt'
}

## ⭐Testing Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each Image have it's disease name so you can verify model is working perfact or not.
